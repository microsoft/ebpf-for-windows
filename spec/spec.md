ELF file validator
=================

All .h and .c files in this folder are generated from the .3d files. To regenerate them:
1) Download the latest drop of EverParse from https://github.com/project-everest/everparse/tags
2) Run ```everparse.cmd external\everparse\src\3d\tests\ELF.3d```
3) Copy the resulting files into a subdirectory named after the .3d file.
4) Run the code formatting tool over the generated files.
