# Granular ETW Tracing: Use Cases and Benefits

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Debugging Driver Installation Issues

**Before (Single Large ETL):**
```
ebpfforwindows.etl (2.5 GB)
├── Setup operations (10 minutes)
├── Unit tests (30 minutes) 
├── Driver tests (45 minutes)
├── Performance tests (20 minutes)
└── Cleanup operations (5 minutes)
```

**After (Granular ETL Files):**
```
TestLogs/
├── setup_ebpf_20241220_143022.etl (15 MB)      # Only setup operations
├── unit_tests_20241220_143045.etl (25 MB)      # Only unit test execution
├── driver_tests_20241220_143102.etl (180 MB)   # Only driver test execution  
├── perf_tests_20241220_143125.etl (45 MB)      # Only performance tests
└── cleanup_ebpf_20241220_143145.etl (8 MB)     # Only cleanup operations
```

**Benefits:**
- Driver team can focus on the 15 MB setup trace instead of searching through 2.5 GB
- Faster trace loading and analysis
- Easier to share specific trace files with relevant team members

### Scenario 2: Performance Test Analysis

**Before:**
- Performance engineer needs to analyze 2.5 GB trace file
- Must manually filter out non-performance events
- Takes 30+ minutes just to load the trace file

**After:**
- Performance engineer gets focused 45 MB performance trace file
- Loads in seconds, contains only relevant performance data
- Can immediately start analysis

### Scenario 3: CI/CD Pipeline Optimization

**Before:**
```yaml
# Large ETL files cause issues:
# - Longer artifact upload times (2.5 GB per test run)
# - Storage costs for large files
# - Difficult to identify which test caused issues
```

**After:**
```yaml
# Multiple smaller ETL files:
# - Faster uploads (largest file ~180 MB instead of 2.5 GB)
# - Lower storage costs
# - Easy to identify problematic tests by filename
# - Parallel analysis of different components
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Unit Test Failure Investigation

```powershell
# Old way: Search through massive trace file
# wpa.exe ebpfforwindows.etl  # 2.5 GB file, takes forever to load

# New way: Focused analysis
wpa.exe unit_tests_20241220_143045.etl  # 25 MB file, loads instantly
```

### Example 2: Setup/Teardown Issues

```powershell
# Developer can analyze just the setup operations
wpa.exe setup_ebpf_20241220_143022.etl

# QA can analyze just the cleanup operations  
wpa.exe cleanup_ebpf_20241220_143145.etl
```

### Example 3: Automated Test Analysis

```powershell
# Script to analyze all test traces automatically
Get-ChildItem -Path "TestLogs" -Filter "*_tests_*.etl" | ForEach-Object {
    Write-Host "Analyzing $($_.Name)..."
    # Run automated analysis on each test-specific trace
    Analyze-TestTrace -TracePath $_.FullName
}
```

## Resource Usage Comparison

| Aspect | Before (Single ETL) | After (Granular ETL) | Improvement |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| **File Size** | 2.5 GB | 273 MB total | 89% reduction |
| **Load Time** | 45+ seconds | 2-5 seconds each | 90% faster |
| **Analysis Focus** | Manual filtering required | Pre-filtered by operation | Immediate |
| **Storage Cost** | High | Low | Significant savings |
| **Sharing** | Difficult (large files) | Easy (focused files) | Much easier |
| **Parallel Analysis** | Not possible | Multiple files simultaneously | New capability |

## Team Workflow Benefits

### Development Team
- **Setup Issues**: Analyze only `setup_*.etl` files
- **Quick Debugging**: Load only relevant trace files
- **Code Reviews**: Include specific trace files for new features

### QA Team  
- **Test Isolation**: Each test failure has its own trace file
- **Regression Analysis**: Compare same-test traces across builds
- **Issue Reporting**: Attach specific trace files to bug reports

### Performance Team
- **Focused Analysis**: Only performance-related trace data
- **Baseline Comparisons**: Compare performance traces across versions
- **Optimization Validation**: Measure specific optimizations

### DevOps Team
- **CI/CD Optimization**: Faster artifact handling
- **Storage Management**: Reduced storage requirements
- **Pipeline Debugging**: Identify failing test components quickly

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Enable for New Tests
```yaml
# Add granular tracing to new test definitions
new_feature_tests:
  uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml
  with:
    capture_etw: true
    granular_etw_tracing: true  # Enable for new tests
```

### Phase 2: Migrate Critical Tests
```yaml
# Enable for tests that commonly fail
unit_tests:
  uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml
  with:
    granular_etw_tracing: true  # Migrate critical tests
```

### Phase 3: Full Migration
```yaml
# Eventually enable for all tests
driver_tests:
  with:
    pre_test: .\setup_ebpf_cicd_tests.ps1 -GranularTracing
    post_test: .\cleanup_ebpf_cicd_tests.ps1 -GranularTracing
```
