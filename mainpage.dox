 *  @section intro Introduction
 *  eBPF is a well-known technology for providing programmability and agility, especially for extending an OS kernel,
 *  for use cases such as DoS protection and observability. This project is a work-in-progress that allows using
 *  existing eBPF toolchains and APIs familiar in the Linux ecosystem to be used on top of Windows. That is, this
 *  project takes existing eBPF projects as submodules and adds the layer in between to make them run on top of Windows.
 *
 *  For more info, see the
 *  <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows#architectural-overview">Architectural Overview</a>.
 *
 *  @section hooks eBPF Program Reference
 *  The following hooks are currently exposed to eBPF programs that include ebpf_nethooks.h:
 *  <ul>
 *   <li>\ref EBPF_PROGRAM_TYPE_BIND : Program type for handling socket bind() requests.</li>
 *   <li>\ref EBPF_PROGRAM_TYPE_XDP : Program type for handling incoming packets as early as possible.</li>
 *  </ul>
 *  More hooks will be added over time.
 *
 *  eBPF programs can also call helper APIs to do additional processing.  There are two types of helpers:
 *  <ul>
 *   <li>Helpers defined in bpf_helpers.h which are accessible to all program types.
 *   <li>Helpers specific to a given program type and declared in other headers.
 *  </ul>
 *  The documentation for each program type will list which helper header files can be used for that program type.
 *  Similarly such documentation for each program type will give the API prototype to implement, and the list
 *  of supported attach types that can be used when attaching an eBPF program.  Most program types have only
 *  a single attach type, but some may support multiple places to which the same type of program can be attached.
 *
 *  @section api eBPF User-Mode API Reference
 *
 *  User-mode applications have access to three types of APIs:
 *  <ul>
 *   <li> Libbpf APIs defined in libbpf.h.
 *   <li> Libbpf APIs defined in [**bpf.h**](bpf_8h.html).
 *   <li> Additional APIs defined in ebpf_api.h.  Many of these are temporary and will be replaced as more
 *        Libbpf APIs are supported directly.
 *  </ul>
