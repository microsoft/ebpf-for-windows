# Test Implementation Summary

## Files Added/Modified

### Test Files Added:
1. **`tests/sample/dual_stack_redirect_test.c`** - New eBPF sample program demonstrating dual stack redirect logic
2. **`tests/connect_redirect/README_DUAL_STACK_TESTS.md`** - Documentation for running and understanding the tests

### Test Files Modified:
3. **`tests/connect_redirect/connect_redirect_tests.cpp`** - Added comprehensive end-to-end tests for dual stack redirect scenarios
4. **`tests/netebpfext_unit/netebpfext_unit.cpp`** - Added unit tests for redirect handle behavior
5. **`tests/sample/sample.vcxproj.filters`** - Added new sample program to build system

## Test Coverage Summary

### 1. End-to-End Tests (`connect_redirect_tests.cpp`)
- **Function**: `dual_stack_redirected_by_self_test()`
- **Test Cases**: 3 test cases covering TCP, UNCONNECTED_UDP, CONNECTED_UDP
- **Scenario**: Full dual stack redirect workflow validation
- **Key Validation**: Proxy connections recognized as REDIRECTED_BY_SELF

### 2. Unit Tests (`netebpfext_unit.cpp`)
- **Test**: `dual_stack_redirect_handle_per_filter_context` - Validates shared redirect handles
- **Test**: `dual_stack_redirect_context_consistency` - Validates initialization order fix

### 3. Sample eBPF Program (`dual_stack_redirect_test.c`)
- Demonstrates dual stack redirect logic
- Includes counters for tracking filter invocations
- Provides isolated test environment for dual stack scenarios

## How Tests Validate PR #2562 Fix

### Problem Validated:
1. **Dual Stack Socket Issue**: Tests create dual stack socket (AF_INET6) connecting to IPv4-mapped address
2. **Filter Mismatch**: Validates v6 filter triggered for dual stack, v4 filter for proxy
3. **Redirect State Detection**: Ensures proxy connection recognized as REDIRECTED_BY_SELF not REDIRECTED_BY_OTHER
4. **Infinite Loop Prevention**: Verifies no continuous redirection occurs

### Solution Validated:
1. **Per-Filter-Context Handle**: Tests confirm redirect handles shared between v4/v6 filters for same eBPF program
2. **Proper Cleanup**: Unit tests validate redirect handle cleanup on detach
3. **Initialization Order**: Tests validate sock_addr_ctx initialized before WFP field access

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites:
- Windows build environment with WDK
- eBPF for Windows components built
- Network test infrastructure (TCP/UDP listeners)

### Commands:
```cmd
# Build
msbuild ebpf-for-windows.sln

# Run dual stack specific tests
connect_redirect_tests.exe --tags="[connect_authorize_redirect_tests_dual_stack_redirected_by_self]"

# Run unit tests
netebpfext_unit.exe --tags="[dual_stack_redirect]"
```

## Expected Results:
- ✅ Dual stack sockets properly redirected through v6 filter
- ✅ Proxy IPv4 connections not re-redirected (REDIRECTED_BY_SELF detection)
- ✅ No infinite redirect loops
- ✅ All protocol types (TCP, UDP) work correctly
- ✅ Proper cleanup of redirect handles

## Integration Notes:
- Tests use existing test infrastructure and patterns
- Minimal changes to existing codebase
- Comprehensive coverage of the specific issue from PR #2562
- Documentation provided for maintainability
