            This is an automated reminder that a new release for eBPF is scheduled to be created:

            - [ ] Ensure SPGO data is regenerated and added to the repo using performance test suite.
            - [ ] Follow instructions in [ReleaseProcess.md](https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows/blob/main/docs/ReleaseProcess.md).
            - [ ] Sync the internal `undock` and follow the internal release instructions in `\.internal\docs\ReleaseEbpfRedistProcess.md`.
