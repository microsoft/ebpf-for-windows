    # 'after_n_builds' calculation.
    # This value needs to match the actual number of 'Per PR' tasks listed in the .github\cicd.yml` file that upload
    # code coverage data.  Note that we DO NOT consider the 'scheduled' tasks in this calculation.
    #
    # Algorithm:
    # Initialize 'after_n_builds' to zero.
    # For each 'Per-PR' task in '.github\cicd.yml' (Ignore 'scheduled' tasks).
    #   - If the task does not have the 'uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml' clause, ignore the task.
    #   - If the task does not have the 'code_coverage: true' clause, ignore the task.
    #   - If the task does not have the 'configurations: ...' clause,
    #         add 2 (two) to after_n_builds.
    #     else
    #         add the number of comma-separated configurations to after_n_builds.
    # 'after_n_builds' is now set to the right count.
