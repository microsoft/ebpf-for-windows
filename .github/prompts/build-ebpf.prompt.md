## Tools

- `run_in_terminal`: Execute MSBuild commands and capture build output
- `get_errors`: Retrieve compilation errors and warnings from VS Code
- `read_file`: Examine source files and build configuration
- `list_dir`: Navigate project structure when needed

## Instructions

Read the full build reference before proceeding:

```
.github/skills/build-ebpf/SKILL.md
```

Follow the instructions in that file to determine the correct MSBuild target(s), configuration, and commands. That file is the authoritative reference for all eBPF for Windows build operations.
