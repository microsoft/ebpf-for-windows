# Malformed ELF Files

The ELF files in this folder are all malformed. They were generated by the bpf2c_fuzzer or the verifier_fuzzer.

If a crash is encountered while fuzzing, add the malformed ELF file to this folder to ensure that a regression
test is run to confirm the issue is fixed.

In addition add an entry to tests\bpf2c_tests\elf_bpf.cpp with the expected error returned from bpf2c for this
file.

Files in this folder have a name derived from the SHA1 hash of the file. This ensures that the files are unique
and avoids merge conflicts when adding new malformed file samples.
