# libFuzzer based fuzzing tools

## Overview
[LibFuzzer](https://www.llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) is an in-process, coverage-guided, evolutionary fuzzing engine. It uses a set of starting data (the corpus)
to generate new test cases, measures the code-coverage of the new test, and re-combines it form new test cases.

There are now four libFuzzer-based binaries:

* bpf2c_fuzzer
* core_helper_fuzzer
* execution_context_fuzzer
* verifier_fuzzer

## Usage
1) Copy the libFuzzer binary and existing corpus to a test machine (currently only Windows 10 and Server 2019 are supported).
2) Start the libFuzzer binary, pass the path to the corpus folder, and maximum time to run:
  * `bpf2c_fuzzer.exe bpf2c_fuzzer_corpus -use_value_profile=1 -max_total_time=1800`
  * `core_helper_fuzzer.exe core_helper_fuzzer core_helper_corpus -max_len=139 -runs=3000 -use_value_profile=1`
  * `execution_context_fuzzer.exe execution_context_fuzzer_corpus -use_value_profile=1 -max_total_time=1800`
  * `verifier_fuzzer.exe verifier_corpus -use_value_profile=1 -max_total_time=1800`
3) If the fuzzer hits an issue, it will display the stack trace and create a file containing the input that triggered the crash.
4) Copy any new test cases and check them into the repo.

## Reproducing a crash
When the fuzzer finds an input that triggers a crash it will create a file with a "crash-" prefix followed by the SHA1
of the input that caused the crash. To reproduce the crash (for debugging), run the fuzzer again, passing the file
name in place of the corpus folder.

## Future
Once funding is available, we should set up a OneFuzz cluster and have the CI/CD pipeline deploy to it.
