# Release Process

This file details the steps for creating a versioned release of
eBPF for Windows, and how to service it later.

>**Note**: Currently releases are *not* production signed and therefore considered as "pre-releases". Their versioning is currently fixed to *Major Version (i.e., "X")* set to "`0`", therefore versioned as "`0.Y.Z`".

## Creating a new release

1. Create a working branch from "`main`" on your private repo fork, and check it out (e.g., `<user>/release-X-Y-Z`).
1. Run the following script from the root directory of the repository, within a "*Developer Poweshell for VS 2022"* instance. Make sure to follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org) ("`X.Y.Z`"):

    ```ps
    # Replace "X.Y.Z" with the new version number being released
    .\scripts\update-release-version.ps1 X Y Z
    ```

    A successful run of the script will produce output similar to the following:

    ```ps
    PS D:\work\ebpf-for-windows> .\scripts\update-release-version.ps1 0 12 0
    Updating the version number in the 'D:\work\ebpf-for-windows\scripts\..\resource\ebpf_version.h' file...
    Version number updated to '0.12.0' in D:\work\ebpf-for-windows\scripts\..\resource\ebpf_version.h
    Updating the version number in the 'D:\work\ebpf-for-windows\scripts\..\installer\Product.wxs' file...
    Version number updated to '0.12.0' in D:\work\ebpf-for-windows\scripts\..\installer\Product.wxs
    Rebuilding the solution, please wait...
    Regenerating the expected 'bpf2c' output...
    Generating output for atomic_instruction_fetch_add.o
    ...
    ...
    Generating output for printk_unsafe.o
    Expected 'bpf2c' output regenerated.
    Please verify all the changes then submit the pull-request into the 'release/0.12' branch.
    ```
1. Verify all the changes then commit all in the working branch.
    >NOTE: The formatting rules may complain about the formatting of the generated `.c` files from the script above. In this case, override them with the following (so they'll work with the `bpf2c_tests` verifying their content):
    >```bash
    >git commit --no-verify
    >```
1. Create a **Draft** pull-request for your branch into the main repo's "`main`" branch (which you created in step 1), and title the PR as *"Release v`X.Y.Z`"* (replace "`X.Y.Z`" with the version number being released).
1. Once the CI/CD pipeline for the PR completes, download the "`ebpf-for-windows - MSI installer (Build-x64_Release)`" and "`ebpf-for-windows - NuGet package (Build-x64_Release)`" build artifacts
   (accessible via the "`Actions`" tab on GitHub).
1. Extract the `*.msi` and `*.nupkg` files, respectively, out of them, and rename them in the following format (replace "`X.Y.Z`" with the version number being released):

    - `eBPF-for-Windows.X.Y.Z.msi`
    - `eBPF-for-Windows.X.Y.Z.nupkg`
1. Submit the PR for review (from its draft state), and wait for it to be approved and merged into the main repo's "`main`" branch.
1. On the main `ebpf-for-windows` repo, create a new release branch from `main` **corresponding to the previous PR's commit**, name it "`release/X.Y`" (replace "X.Y" with the version number being released).
1. Publish the release as per the "[Publishing a Release](ReleaseProcess.md#publishing-a-release)" process.

## Servicing a release

Servicing a release has two main scenarios:

### Updating a Release branch with patches/hot-fixes from main (*Forward Integration*)

>NOTE: In servicing a release branch, **new features must not be added to the release branch**.  Only patches or hot-fixes will be accepted.

1. On the main `ebpf-for-windows` repo, create and check out a new working branch from the `/release/X.Y` branch you want to service.
1. Run the following script from the root directory of the repository, within a "*Developer Poweshell for VS 2022"* instance. Make sure to follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org) ("`X.Y.Z`"):

    ```ps
    # Replace "X.Y.Z" with the new version number being released
    .\scripts\update-release-version.ps1 X Y Z
    ```
1. Cherry pick the commits from `main` that you want to add to the release (patches/hot-fixes, etc.):

    ```bash
    git cherry-pick main <commit number> ... <commit number>
    ```
    If there are conflicts, resolve them. For example, via:
    ```bash
    git mergetool
    ```
1. Verify all the changes then commit all in the working branch.
    >NOTE: The formatting rules may complain about the formatting of the generated `.c` files from the script above. In this case, override them with the following (so they'll work with the `bpf2c_tests` verifying their content):
    >```bash
    >git commit --no-verify
    >```
1. Create a **Draft** pull-request for your working branch into the main repo's "`release/X.Y`" branch, and title the PR as *"Release v`X.Y.Z`"* (replace "`X.Y.Z`" with the version number being released).
1. Wait for  the CI/CD pipeline for the PR to complete successfully.
1. Submit the PR for review (from its draft state), and wait for it to be approved and merged into the main repo's "`release/X.Y`" branch.
1. Publish the release as per the "[Publishing a Release](ReleaseProcess.md#publishing-a-release)" process.


### Updating the main brach with patches/hot-fixes from a Release branch (*Reverse/Backwards Integration*)

>IMPORTANT! Normally, this should be done by the release manager **in VERY RARE scenarios** (and it's also likely an indication there's been a failure in the releasing process), but if you are a contributor and have been asked to do this, here are the steps to be followed:

1. On the main `ebpf-for-windows` repo, create and check out a new working branch from the "`main`" branch.
1. Cherry pick the commits from the "`release/X.Y`" branch branch that you want to add to the "`main`" branch (patches/hot-fixes, etc.):

    ```bash
    git cherry-pick release/X.Y <commit number> ... <commit number>
    ```
    If there are conflicts, resolve them. For example, via:
    ```bash
    git mergetool
    ```
1. Commit all the changes in the working branch.
1. Create a **Draft** pull-request for your working branch into the main repo's "`main`" branch, and title the PR as *"Backwards Integration of Release v`X.Y.Z`"* (replace "`X.Y.Z`" with the version number being released).
1. Wait for the CI/CD pipeline for the PR to complete successfully.
1. Submit the PR for review (from its draft state), and wait for it to be approved and merged into the main repo's "`main`" branch.
1. Create a tag for the PR's commit number, on the main repo's "`main`" branch, with meaningful name (i.e., "*RI-from-release-vX.Y.Z*").

## Publishing a Release

As a result of creating new release or servicing an existing one, the following steps are required to publish the release:

### Publishing the Release to GitHub

1. On the `microsoft/ebpf-for-windows` repo's `main` branch, create a tag for the release-PR's commit. The tag should reflect the version number being released and adhere to the following notation: "`vX.Y.Z`".
1. The tag creation will automatically trigger the "`CI/CD - Release validation`" workflow for the PR: wait for it to complete successfully.
1. Once the CI/CD pipeline completes successfully, wait for the `sign-off` label to be added from the Triage meeting, on the automated "release-issue" associated to the release to be published.
1. Go to the repo on GitHub and click on "`<Code>`" and click on right the "`Create a new release`" link.
1. Click on the "`Choose a tag`" combo box and select the tag with new "`vX.Y.Z`" version number, as created earlier.
1. Fill in the release title as "`vX.Y.Z`" (replace "`X.Y.Z`" with the version number being released).
1. Manually enter release notes or click "`Generate release notes`" and then edit as desired.
1. Attach the `.msi`, the (non-redist) `.nupkg`, and the `Build-x64-native-only-Release.X.Y.Z.zip` build (from the CI/CD artifacts), by dropping them in the "`Attach binaries by dropping them here or selecting them.`" area. For example, the file list for `v0.11.0` should be:

    - *Build-x64-native-only-Release.0.11.0.zip*
    - *ebpf-for-windows.0.11.0.msi*
    - *eBPF-for-Windows.0.11.0.nupkg*

1. Check the "`Set as a pre-release`" checkbox, unless the release is production-signed.
1. Once the uploads are complete, click "`Publish release`".

### Publishing the Release to NuGet.org

Upload the (**non-redist**) `.nupkg` file to [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/) (the metadata inside the `.nuget` package itself will automatically populate all the other form fields).
