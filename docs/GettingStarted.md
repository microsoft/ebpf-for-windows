# Getting Started

If you just want to install eBPF for Windows on a machine to experiment with,
jump down to [Installing eBPF for Windows](#installing-ebpf-for-windows).

If you just want to compile, but not run, eBPF programs and applications that interact with them,
jump down to [Using eBPF in development](#using-ebpf-in-development).

## Building eBPF for Windows

### Prerequisites

The following must be installed in order to build this project:

1. Git (e.g., [Git for Windows 64-bit](https://git-scm.com/download/win))
1. **Visual Studio 2022** - one of the following editions should be installed (once installed, upgrade to **v17.4.2 or later**):

   - [Download Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=17) (free)

   - [Download Visual Studio Enterprise 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Enterprise&rel=17)

   during the installation, select the following feature from the *Visual Studio Installer*:

   - `"Desktop development with C++"` (ensure that the "*C++ Address Sanitizer*" component is installed)

   including the following *Spectre* library, which must be selected from the "*Individual components*" tab in the *Visual Studio Installer*:

   - `"MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 Spectre-mitigated libs (latest)"`

1. [Visual Studio Build Tools 2022](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_buildtools.exe) (version **17.4.2 or later**).
1. [WiX Toolset v3 - Visual Studio 2022 Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WixToolset.WixToolsetVisualStudio2022Extension).
1.[SDK for Windows 11, version 22H2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2196241) (version **10.0.22621.x**).
1. [WDK for Windows 11, version 22H2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2196230) (version **10.0.22621.x**), including the
 "*Windows Driver Kit Visual Studio extension*" (make sure the "*Install Windows Driver Kit Visual Studio Extension*"
  check box is checked before completing the installer).
    >Note: as multiple versions of WDKs cannot coexist side-by-side, you may be asked to uninstall previous versions.
1. [Clang for Windows 64-bit](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-11.0.1/LLVM-11.0.1-win64.exe) (version **11.0.1**).
 Note: clang versions 12 and higher are NOT yet supported, as they perform program optimizations that are incompatible with the PREVAIL verifier.
1. [NuGet Windows x86 Commandline](https://www.nuget.org/downloads) (version **6.31 or higher**), which can be installed to a location
 such as "C:\Program Files (x86)\NuGet\".

You should add the paths to `git.exe`, `cmake.exe` and `nuget.exe` to the Windows PATH environment variable after the software packages
 above have been installed.

Alternative install steps (for *basic* Visual Studio Community edition):

1. Launch an administrative PowerShell session.
1. Install [Chocolatey Package Manager for Windows](https://chocolatey.org/install) by running the following commands in the PowerShell session:

   ```ps
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
   ```

1. Run the following command to automatically setup the dev environment:

   ```ps
   Invoke-WebRequest 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows/main/scripts/Setup-DevEnv.ps1' -OutFile $env:TEMP\Setup-DeveEnv.ps1
   if ((get-filehash $env:TEMP\Setup-DeveEnv.ps1).Hash -eq '9B9C4358B05DBD16EF58C0548B1ADBA4B5591FE14DFD3239FC580BB95B39988C') { &"$env:TEMP\Setup-DeveEnv.ps1" }
   ```
   >**Note**: the WDK for Windows 11 is [not currently available on Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages?q=windowsdriverkit),
    please install manually with the link in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section above.

### How to clone and build the project using Visual Studio

This section outlines the steps to build, prepare and build the eBPF-For-Windows project.

#### Cloning the project

Clone the eBPF for Windows projects and its submodules by running:

   ```cmd
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows.git
   ```
>Note: by default this will clone the project under the `ebpf-for-windows` directory.

#### Exclusion of PE parse directory from Windows Defender Antivirus

PE parse directory includes some malformed PE images as a part of the test suite for PE image parser and Windows Defender flags these files as viruses. Please note that similar exclusions have to be done for other Antivirus products as needed. The following steps are needed to exempt PE directory from Windows Defender Antivirus:
1. Select *Start*, then open *Settings*. Under *Privacy & Security*, select *Virus & threat protection*.
2. Under *Virus & threat protection* settings, select *Manage settings*, and then under *Exclusions*, select *Add or remove exclusions*.
3. Select *Add an exclusion*, and then select from files, folders, file types, or processes. Choose the following directory ```ebpf-for-windows/external/pe-parse``` to exclude the folder and subfolders to get flagged by the antivirus.

#### Prepare for first build

The following steps need to be executed *once* before the first build on a new clone:

1. Launch `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022` by running:

   ```cmd
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat"
   ```
1. Change directory to where the project is cloned (e.g. `cd ebpf-for-windows`), and run the following commands:

   - `cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -S external\ebpf-verifier -B external\ebpf-verifier\build`
   - `cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -S external\catch2 -B external\catch2\build -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF`
   - `cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -S external\ubpf -B external\ubpf\build`
   - `nuget restore ebpf-for-windows.sln`

      >**Note**: you may get the following transitory error, which can be safely ignored as the *WiX Toolset* nuget package will be installed immediately afterwards:
      >
      >    `error : The WiX Toolset v3.11 build tools must be installed to build this project. To download the WiX Toolset, see https://wixtoolset.org/releases/v3.11/stable`

   - `del external\ebpf-verifier\build\obj\project.assets.json` (Note: the file may not be present)

#### Building using Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022

1. Launch `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022`.
1. Change directory to where the project is cloned (e.g. `cd ebpf-for-windows`), and run the following command:

   ```cmd
   msbuild /m /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64 ebpf-for-windows.sln
   ```

##### Setting compile time options when building from Developer Command Prompt

To build with the specific compile time options for disabling JIT compiler and/or the Interpreter, append "`/p:<option>=True`". Available options are:

1. `DisableJIT` - Compile eBPF's *Execution Context* without support for eBPF JIT compiler.
1. `DisableInterpreter` - Compile eBPF's *Execution Context* without support for eBPF interpreter.

#### Building using Visual Studio IDE

1. Open the `ebpf-for-windows.sln` solution.
1. Switch the configuration to "`Debug`|`x64`".
1. Rebuild the solution.

##### Setting compile time options when building from Visual Studio IDE

To build with the specific compile time options for disabling JIT compiler and/or the interpreter:

1. Select the project to modify from the Solution Explorer.
1. Navigate to "`C/C++`" -> "`Preprocessor`" -> "`Preprocessor Definitions`"
1. Click the "`V`" combobox arrow and then "`Edit`" for adding the option(s) to the list of preprocessor options. Available options are:

   *  `CONFIG_BPF_JIT_DISABLED` - Compile eBPF's *Execution Context* without support for the eBPF JIT compiler.
   *  `CONFIG_BPF_INTERPRETER_DISABLED` - Compile eBPF's *Execution Context* without support for the eBPF interpreter.

      >*Note for Linux users*: this option is similar to the `CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON` which, as documented 
[here](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html), is used to disable support for the interpreter.

>Note: do the above steps for the following projects within the `ebpf-for-windows.sln` solution:
>- `api_test`
>- `execution_context_kernel`
>- `sample_ext_app`

This will build the following binaries:

- `ebpfcore.sys`: The kernel-mode execution context in which eBPF programs run.
- `netebpfext.sys`: The kernel-mode extension for WFP hooks.
- `ebpfapi.dll`: A user-mode shared library exposing APIs for apps to call to perform operations such as
               loading eBPF programs.
- `ebpfnetsh.dll`: A plugin for the Windows netsh.exe command line tool that provides eBPF command line
                 utility functionality.
- `ebpfsvc.exe`: A user-mode service that verifies and loads an eBPF program in the execution context.
- `unit_tests.exe`: A collection of tests using the Catch framework.  These tests are also run as part
                  of the Github CI/CD so should always pass.
- `api_test.exe`: A collection of tests that exercises eBPF user mode APIs. This requires EbpfSvc service to be running,
                and EbpfCore and NetEbpfExt drivers to be loaded.
- `sample_ebpf_ext.sys`: A sample eBPF extension driver that implements a test hook (for a test program type) and test helper functions.
- `sample_ext_app.exe`: A sample application for testing the sample extension driver.
- `xdp_tests.exe`: Application for testing various XDP functionalities.  This requires the EbpfSvc service to be running,
                and the EbpfCore and NetEbpfExt drivers to be loaded on a remote system to test.
- `socket_tests.exe`: Application for testing the eBPF extension that implements the BPF_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR program type and related attach types.

and a few binaries just used for demo'ing eBPF functionality, as in the demo walkthrough discussed below:

- `dnsflood.exe`: A utility to send 0-byte DNS packets, to illustrate a case that the sample walkthrough uses eBPF to defend against.
- `port_leak.exe`: A "buggy" utility to illustrate the effect of an app that leaks ports.
- `port_quota.exe`: A sample utility to illustrate using eBPF to manage port quotas to defend against `port_leak.exe` and similar "buggy" apps.

### How to clone and build the project using CMake

#### Cloning the project

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows.git
```

#### Configuring the project

```bash
cmake -S ebpf-for-windows -B build
```

#### Building the project

Configuration: It is advised to use the Debug configuration for now.

```bash
cmake --build build --config <Configuration>
```

#### Running the tests

Configure with the `EBPFFORWINDOWS_ENABLE_TESTS` option (enabled by default)

```bash
cmake -S ebpf-for-windows -B build -DEBPFFORWINDOWS_ENABLE_TESTS=true
```

Then build the tests

```bash
cmake -S ebpf-for-windows -B build
```

Finally, invoke CTest:

```bash
cd build
ctest -V -C Debug
```

## Installing eBPF for Windows

Windows requires that one of the following criteria be met prior to loading a driver:

1. Driver is signed using a certificate that chains up to the Microsoft code signing root (aka a production signed driver).
1. The OS is booted with a kernel debugger attached.
1. The OS is running in [test-signing mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/the-testsigning-boot-configuration-option),
 the [driver is test signed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/test-signing-a-driver-through-an-embedded-signature)
  and the [test certificate is installed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/installing-test-certificates).

Since the eBPF for Windows binaries are not yet signed by Microsoft, they will only work on a machine with
a kernel debugger (KD) attached and running, or test signing is enabled. (It is expected that official
releases of eBPF for Windows will eventually be production signed at some point in the future after
security hardening is completed.)

For basic testing, the simplest way to install eBPF for Windows is into a Windows VM with test signing enabled.
Follow the [VM Installation Instructions](vm-setup.md) and [eBPF Installation Instructions](InstallEbpf.md) to do so.

## Using eBPF for Windows

If you're not already familiar with eBPF, or want a detailed walkthrough, see our [eBPF tutorial](tutorial.md).

For API documentation, see <https://microsoft.github.io/ebpf-for-windows/>

### Port leak and bind observability demo

This section shows how to use eBPF for Windows in a demo that lets us control a UDP port leak by attaching an eBPF
 program to the socket `bind()` call via the `EBPF_ATTACH_TYPE_BIND` hook.

#### Prep

1. Build the ``port_leak`` and ``port_quota`` applications from under the tools project.
1. Copy both the exe's to a machine that has eBPF installed. See
   [Installing eBPF for Windows](#installing-ebpf-for-windows)

#### Demo

1. At a command prompt running as Administrator, run `port_quota.exe load` to load the port quota eBPF program attached to the bind hook.
1. Set a limit to a threshold number of ports you want to permit an application to bind to by doing `port_quota.exe limit 5000`
1. Run `port_leak.exe` in another command prompt. This will just leak UDP ports. Observe the output that bind starts to fail after this
 app binds 5000 ports.
1. Running `port_quota.exe stats` will dump how many ports are taken up by an application. Under the covers,
 the eBPF program communicates this information up to the user mode application via an eBPF map.

### DNS flood attack demo

This section shows how to use eBPF for Windows in a demo that defends against a 0-byte UDP attack on a DNS server.

#### Prep

Set up 2 VMs, which we will refer to as the "attacker" machine and the "defender" machine.

On a defender machine with [eBPF installed](#installing-ebpf-for-windows), do the following:

1. Install and set up a DNS server.
1. Make sure that either test signing was enabled as discussed in
   [Installing eBPF for Windows](#installing-ebpf-for-windows), or the kernel debugger (KD) is attached and running.
1. Install [clang](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-11.0.1/LLVM-11.0.1-win64.exe)
   if not already installed on the defender machine.
1. Copy `droppacket.c` and `ebpf.h` to a folder (such as `c:\test`).

On the attacker machine, do the following:

1. Copy `DnsFlood.exe` to attacker machine

#### Demo

##### On the attacker machine

1. Run ```for /L %i in (1,1,4) do start /min DnsFlood <ip of defender>```

##### On the defender machine

1. Start performance monitor and add UDPv4 Datagrams/sec
1. Show that 200K packets per second are being received
1. Show & explain code of `droppacket.c`
1. Compile `droppacket.c`:
   ```cmd
   clang -target bpf -O2 -Werror -c droppacket.c -o droppacket.o
   ```
1. Show eBPF byte code for `droppacket.o`:
   ```cmd
   netsh ebpf show disassembly droppacket.o xdp
   ```
1. Show that the verifier checks the code:
   ```cmd
   netsh ebpf show verification droppacket.o xdp
   ```
1. Launch netsh `netsh`
1. Switch to ebpf context `ebpf`
1. Load eBPF program, and note the ID:
   ```cmd
   add program droppacket.o xdp
   ```
1. Show UDP datagrams received drop to under 10 per second
1. Unload program:
   ```bash
   delete program <id>     #Note: where `<id>` is the ID noted above.
   ```
1. Show UDP datagrams received drop to back up to ~200K per second
1. Modify `droppacket.c` to be unsafe - **Comment out line 20 & 21**
1. Compile `droppacket.c`:
   ```cmd
   clang -target bpf -O2 -Werror -c droppacket.c -o droppacket.o
   ```
1. Show that the verifier rejects the code:
   ```cmd
   netsh ebpf show verification droppacket.o xdp
   ```
1. Show that loading the program fails:
   ```cmd
   netsh ebpf add program droppacket.o xdp
   ```

## Tests in Ebpf-For-Windows

The tests in Ebpf-For-Windows are written using the [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) test framework.

### unit_tests.exe

This test uses a mocking layer to bind the user mode components to the kernel mode
components via a Mock IOCTL interface. The tests initialize the user mode and kernel
mode components, load an eBPF program from an ELF file, and then run the eBPF program
by having the mocked extensions emit events.

### api_test.exe

This test exercises various eBPF user mode eBPF APIs, including those to load programs,
enumerate maps and programs etc. This test requires the eBPF user mode service (EbpfSvc), and the
kernel execution context (`EbpfCore.sys`) and the Network Extension (`NetEbpfExt.sys`) to be running.
This test is currently *not* part of the CI pipeline. Developers must run this test manually before
checking in changes.

### sample_ext_app.exe

This is a test application for the sample eBPF extension. This application loads a test eBPF program
and attaches it to the test hook implemented by the sample extension and validates if the eBPF program
executed as expected.

### Running the tests

1. Set the build output folder as the current working directory.
2. Invoke the appropriate exe.

The Catch2 exes have various command line options to control behavior. Default
behavior is to run all the tests and only print information about failing test
cases.

Other useful options include:

1. `-s` to list both passing and failing test cases
1. `-b` to break into the debugger on test failure
1. `-l` to list test cases
1. `Test_name` to run a single test

### xdp_tests.exe

This application tests various XDP functionalities. These tests require two hosts to run. There are three variations of the XDP tests.

#### Reflection Test

This tests the XDP_TX functionality.

1. On the first host:
   1. [Install eBPF for Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows/blob/main/docs/InstallEbpf.md).
   1. Load the test eBPF program by running the following command, and note the ID (see **Note 3** below):
      ```cmd
      netsh ebpf add program reflect_packet.o xdp
      ```
1. On the second host:
   1. Allow inbound traffic for `xdp_tests.exe` through Windows Defender Firewall. See **Note 1** below.
   1. Run (see **Note 2** below):

      ```cmd
      xdp_tests.exe xdp_reflect_test --remote-ip <IP on the first host>
      ```

#### Encapsulation Test

This uses `bpf_xdp_adjust_head` helper function to encapsulate an outer IP header to a packet.

1. On the first host:
   1. [Install eBPF for Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows/blob/main/docs/InstallEbpf.md).
   1. Load the test eBPF program by running the following command, and note the ID (see **Note 3** below):

      ```cmd
      netsh ebpf add program encap_reflect_packet.o xdp
      ```
1. On the second host:
   1. Allow inbound traffic for `xdp_tests.exe` through Windows Defender Firewall. See **Note 1** below.
   1. Run  (see **Note 3** below):

      ```cmd
      xdp_tests.exe xdp_encap_reflect_test --remote-ip <IP on the first host>
      ```

#### Decapsulation Test

This uses `bpf_xdp_adjust_head` helper function to decapsulate an outer IP header from a packet.

1. On *both* the hosts, [install eBPF for Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows/blob/main/docs/InstallEbpf.md).
1. On the first host load the first test eBPF program by running the following command. and note the ID (see **Note 3** below):
   ```cmd
   netsh ebpf add program encap_reflect_packet.o xdp
   ```
1. On the second host:
   1. Load the second test eBPF program by running the following command, and note the ID (see **Note 3** below):
      ```cmd
      netsh ebpf add program decap_permit_packet.o xdp
      ```
   2. Allow inbound traffic for `xdp_tests.exe` through Windows Defender Firewall. See **Note 1** below.
   3. Run the following command (see **Note 3** below):
      ```cmd
      xdp_tests.exe xdp_reflect_test --remote-ip <IP on the first host>
      ```
      **Note 1:** To allow inbound traffic to `xdp_tests.exe`, in a Windows Powershell with administrative privilege, run:
      ```cmd
      New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "XDP_Test" -Program "<Full path to xdp_tests.exe>" -Direction Inbound -Action Allow
      ```
      **Note 2:** For the `--remote-ip` parameter to `xdp_tests.exe` program that is run on the second host,
       pass an IPv4 or IPv6 address of an Ethernet-like interface on the first host in string format.

      **Note 3:** After completion of each test variation, unload the eBPF programs from both host machines by running
       `delete program <id>` on the netsh prompt, where `<id>` is the ID noted when the eBPF programs were loaded.

      ***Advanced:*** The eBPF program can be attached to a specific interface by passing `interface=<IfIndex>`
 parameter either to the netsh `add program` or `set program` commands.

### socket_tests.exe

This application loads the `cgroup_sock_addr.o` eBPF program and attaches to hooks to handle various socket operations.
 Currently it tests authorizing ingress and egress connections based on entries in a map passed to the program.

### Using tracing

eBPF for Windows uses ETW for tracing.  A trace can be captured in a file, or viewed in real-time.

### Capturing traces

To capture a trace in a file use the following commands:

1. Start tracing:
   ```cmd
   wpr.exe -start "%ProgramFiles%\ebpf-for-windows\ebpfforwindows.wprp" -filemode
   ```
   This will capture traces from eBPF execution context and the network eBPF extension drivers.
    >**Note**: The path `%ProgramFiles%\ebpf-for-windows` assumes you installed eBPF for Windows via the MSI file, using the default installation folder.
         If you installed it in another folder or via some other method, [ebpfforwindows.wprp](../scripts/ebpfforwindows.wprp) may be in some other location.
1. Run the scenario to be traced.
1. Stop tracing:
   ```cmd
   wpr.exe -stop ebpfforwindows.etl
   ```
1. Convert the traces to text format:
   ```cmd
   netsh trace convert ebpfforwindows.etl overwrite=yes
   ```
   or, to convert to CSV format, use:

   ```cmd
   netsh trace convert ebpfforwindows.etl ebpfforwindows.csv csv
   ```

### Viewing traces in real-time

To view traces in real-time, the `tracelog.exe` and `tracefmt.exe` commands from the WDK can be used.
If you are running eBPF for Windows in a VM, you can either install the full WDK in the VM (see the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
section above) or just copy the two executables into the VM.

To view all eBPF trace events that would be captured to a file, use the following commands:

1. Create a trace session with some name such as MyTrace:
   ```cmd
   tracelog -start MyTrace -guid "%ProgramFiles%\[eBPF for Windows install folder]ebpf-all.guid" -rt
   ```
1. View the session in real-time on stdout:
   ```cmd
   tracefmt -rt MyTrace -displayonly -jsonMeta 0
   ```
   This will continue until you break out of the executable with Ctrl-C.
1. Close the trace session:

   ```cmd
   tracelog -stop MyTrace
   ```

Often when tracing eBPF programs, it is useful to only view output generated by the
 [bpf_printk](https://microsoft.github.io/ebpf-for-windows/bpf__helper__defs_8h.html#aae337e68db96b4b9470f8c519386cbec) helper.
To do so, use `ebpf-printk.guid` instead of `ebpf-all.guid` when creating a trace session. That is:

1. Create a trace session with some name such as MyTrace:
   ```cmd
   tracelog -start MyTrace -guid "%ProgramFiles%\[eBPF for Windows install folder]\ebpf-printk.guid" -rt
   ```
1. View the session in real-time on stdout:

   ```cmd
   tracefmt -rt MyTrace -displayonly -jsonMeta 0
   ```
   This will continue until you break out of the executable with Ctrl-C.

1. Close the trace session:

   ```cmd
   tracelog -stop MyTrace
   ```

This will display lines like the following for `bpf_printk("Hello, world");`:

```
[3]1760.1910::03/10/2022-13:56:14.226 [EbpfForWindowsProvider]{"Message":"Hello, world"}
```

where `[3]` is the CPU ID, `1760` is the Process ID in hex, and `1910` is the Thread ID in hex.

If you want the prefix to look closer to Linux output, set the following
 [environment variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/trace-message-prefix):

```
set TRACE_FORMAT_PREFIX=%8!u! [%9!03d!] %4!s!:
```

This will result in lines like:

```
5984 [003] 03/10/2022-13:56:14.226:{"Message":"Hello, world"}
```

where `5984` is the Process ID in decimal, and `003` is the CPU ID.

To view all trace events from the network eBPF extension (`netebpfext.sys`), use the following commands:

1. Create a trace session with some name such as MyTrace:

   ```cmd
   tracelog -start MyTrace -guid net-ebpf-ext.guid -rt
   ```
1. View the session in real-time on stdout:
   ```cmd
   tracefmt -rt NetEbpfExtTrace -displayonly -jsonMeta 0
   ```
   This will continue until you break out of the executable with Ctrl-C.
1. Close the trace session:
   ```cmd
   tracelog -stop NetEbpfExtTrace
   ```

## Using eBPF in Development

If you are developing eBPF programs and applications that interact with them,
your Visual Studio development will need to reference the eBPF for Windows project as follows.

If using Visual Studio as your IDE, your project can add a reference to the
[eBPF-for-Windows](https://www.nuget.org/packages/eBPF-for-Windows) nuget package.
(You can also manually download the nuget package from the
[latest release](https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows/releases).)

If you [installed eBPF for Windows via the MSI](InstallEbpf.md)
and checked the Development checkbox, installation was completed for you.
Otherwise, after installing the nuget package, as a one-time operation, you will
currently need to run the `export_program_info.exe` tool to complete the install. This
tool can be found in your project's `packages\eBPF-for-Windows\build\native\bin` directory.

If you are using WinDbg to work on the EbpfCore or the NetEbpfExt drivers, you may find the WinDbg command ```.kdfiles``` to be useful. This
command allows the replacement of a driver binary on the target machine with another binary from the machine WinDbg is running
on (typically the development machine) at driver load time.

This eliminates the need for repeated manual copy of the modified driver binary and saves considerable time during the
development cycle.  See the [Windows Hardware Developer documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/-kdfiles--set-driver-replacement-map-) for more details.
