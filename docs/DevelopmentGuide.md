Development Guide
=================

Coding Conventions
------------------

* **DO** use fixed length types defined in `stdint.h` instead
  of language keywords determined by the compiler (e.g., `int64_t, uint8_t`, not
  `long, unsigned char`).

* **DO** use `const` and `static` and visibility modifiers to scope exposure of
   variables and methods as much as possible.

* **DO** use doxygen comments, with \[in,out\]
  [direction annotation](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html#cmdparam) in all public API
  headers. This is also encouraged, but not strictly required, for internal API
  headers as well.

* **DO** disable doxygen documentation for elements that are not in the public
  API as described [here](./refman/doxygen-howto.md#disable-doxygen).

* **DON'T** use global variables where possible.

* **DON'T** use abbreviations unless they are already well-known terms known by
  users (e.g., "app", "info"), or are already required for use by developers (e.g.,
  "min", "max", "args").  Examples of bad use would be `num_widgets` instead of
  `widget_count`, and `opt_widgets` instead of `option_widgets` or `optional_widgets`.

* **DON'T** use the same C function name with two different prototypes across
  the project where possible.

* **DON'T** use commented-out code, or code in an `#if 0` or equivalent.  Make sure all code is actually
  built.

Header Files
------------

* **DO** make sure any header file can be included directly, without requiring other
  headers to be included first.  That is, any dependencies should be included within
  the header file itself.

* **DO** include system headers (with `<>`) before local headers (with `""`), and list them
  in alphabetical order where possible.  This helps ensure there are not duplicate includes,
  and also helps ensure that headers are usable directly.

* **DO** use `#pragma once` in all header files, rather than using ifdefs to test for duplicate inclusion.

Style Guide

### Automated Formatting with `clang-format`

For all C/C++ files (`*.c`, `*.cpp` and `*.h`), we use `clang-format` (specifically
version 3.6) to apply our code formatting rules. After modifying C/C++ files and
before merging, be sure to run:

```sh
$ ./scripts/format-code
```

This allows us to apply formatting choices such as the use of [Allman style](
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style) braces and the 80
character column width consistently.

Please stage the formatting changes with your commit, instead of making an extra
"Format Code" commit. Your editor can likely be set up to automatically run
`clang-format` across the file or region you're editing. See:

- [clang-format.el](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/blob/master/tools/clang-format/clang-format.el) for Emacs
- [vim-clang-format](https://github.com/rhysd/vim-clang-format) for Vim
- [vscode-cpptools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
  for Visual Studio Code

The [.clang-format](../.clang-format) file describes the style that is enforced
by the script, which is based off the LLVM style with modifications closer to
the default Visual Studio style. See [clang-format style options](
http://releases.llvm.org/3.6.0/tools/clang/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html)
for details.

### License Header

The following license header **must** be included at the top of every code file:

```
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
```

It should be prefixed with the file's comment marker. If there is a compelling
reason to not include this header, the file can be added to
`.check-license.ignore`.

All files are checked for this header with the script:

```sh
$ ./scripts/check-license
```

### Naming Conventions

Naming conventions we use that are not automated include:

1. Use `lower_snake_case` for variable, member/field, and function names.
2. Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for macro names and constants.
3. Prefer `lower_snake_case` file names for headers and sources.
4. Prefer full words for names over contractions (i.e., `memory_context`, not
   `mem_ctx`).
5. Prefix names with `_` to indicate internal and private fields or methods
   (e.g., `_internal_field, _internal_method()`).
6. The single underscore (`_` ) is reserved for local definitions (static,
   file-scope definitions).
   e.g., static ebpf_result_t _do_something(..).
7. Prefix `struct` definitions with `_` (this is an exception to point 6), and always create a `typedef` with the
   suffix `_t`.  For example:
```c
typedef struct _ebpf_widget
{
    uint64_t count;
} ebpf_widget_t;
```
8. Prefix eBPF specific names in the global namespace with `ebpf_` (e.g., `ebpf_result_t`).

Above all, if a file happens to differ in style from these guidelines (e.g.,
private members are named `m_member` rather than `_member`), the existing style
in that file takes precedence.
