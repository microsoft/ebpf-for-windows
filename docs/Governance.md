# Project Governance

## Roles and Personnel

The eBPF for Windows project currently uses the following roles, listed
in order of increasing permission:

* Contributor
* Collaborator
* Triage Driver
* Maintainer
* Release Manager
* Project Admin

### Contributor

The ability to read, clone, and contribute issues or
pull requests is open to the public.

Personnel: anyone

Minimum Requirements: (none)

Responsibilities: (none)

### Collaborator

A collaborator is a contributor who can have issues and pull request
review requests assigned to them in github.
This corresponds to the "Read" role in github.

Personnel: @alessandrogario @evershalik @hawkinsw @song-jiang

Minimum Requirements:
* Has attended a triage meeting
* Has agreed to have a github issue assigned to them to work on
* Is approved by the existing [Project Admins](@project-admin)

Responsibilities:
* Contribute pull requests for any assigned issues

### Triage Driver

A triage driver can also manage issues and pull requests,
including assigning them to others and assigning labels and milestones.
This corresponds to the "Triage" role in github.

Personnel: @dahavey

Minimum Requirements:
* Consistently participates in weekly triage meetings
* Has ability and willingness to share screen in Zoom
* Is approved by the existing [Project Admins](@project-admin)

Responsibilities:
* Run the weekly [triage meetings](https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows/discussions/427).
* If the triage meeting is canceled (e.g., due to a holiday),
  announce that fact in the [Slack channel](https://cilium.slack.com/messages/ebpf-for-windows)
  and [github discussion thread](https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows/discussions/427).

### Maintainer

A maintainer can also merge pull requests.
This corresponds to the "Write" role in github.
All maintainers should be be listed in the [CODEOWNERS file](../.github/CODEOWNERS).

Personnel: @Alan-Jowett @dv-msft @gtrevi @matthewige @mtfriesen @rectified95 @saxena-anurag @shpalani

Minimum Requirements:
* Consistently participates in weekly [triage meetings](https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows/discussions/427)
* Has submitted multiple pull requests across at least 2 months that have been merged
* Has provided feedback on multiple pull requests from others, across at least 2 months
* Has demonstrated an understanding of a particular area of the code such as one or more directories
* Is approved by the existing [Project Admins](@project-admin)

Responsibilities:
* [Review pull requests](#reviewing-pull-requests) from others.
* Merge pull requests once tests pass and sufficient approvals exist.

### Release Manager

In addition to having Maintainer privileges and responsibilities,
a release manager is also responsible for generating releases in github.
The release manager for this project must be a Microsoft full time employee in order to build Microsoft-signed binaries that Windows will load.

Personnel: @gtrevi @shpalani @matthewige

Minimum Requirements:
* Consistently participates in weekly [triage meetings](https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows/discussions/427)
* Has acted as a maintainer for at least 2 months
* Has demonstrated an understanding of MSI installation
* Has demonstrated an understanding of the eBPF for Windows release process
* Has access to the Microsoft signing pipeline
* Is approved by the existing [Project Admins](@project-admin)

Responsibilities:
* Generate periodic releases according to the [Release Process.md](ReleaseProcess.md) documentation.
* Create a milestone for each upcoming release (typically four digits of the form YYMM).

### Project Admin

An admin can also assign people to each of these
roles, and have full access to all github settings.
This corresponds to the "Admin" role in github.

Personnel: @dthaler @poornagmsft @shankarseal

Minimum Requirements:
* Has acted as a maintainer
* Knows most or all of the maintainers
* Understands the github Admin settings, such as experience from other projects
* Is approved by the existing Project Admins

Responsibilities:
* At least annually, review the current set of personnel in each [role](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization#repository-roles-for-organizations) and update as needed.
* Manage github settings such as branch protection rules and repository secrets.
* Resolve any disputes among maintainers.

## Project Milestones

eBPF for Windows uses monthly milestones in the format `YYMM`. So, e.g., the milestone for June, 2024 will be called 2406.
At any time, there are four active milestones in the project. There will be a milestone for the current calendar month (`N`),
and two others for the next two months (`N+1`), (`N+2`). And there is always a `Backlog` milestone for backlog issues to be
addressed in the future. In the first triage meeting of a month, the previous milestone must be closed and a new `N+2` milestone must be created.

During the weekly triage meetings, whenever any issue is marked with the "triaged" label, triage drivers MUST set an issue to one of the four milestones
according to the priority of the issues.

## Prioritizing Issues

To help prioritize issues, the triage drivers and maintainers MUST use *special labels* to prioritize issues as follows:
### P1:
This label represents highest priority. This label should be used for bugs impacting users, new features, or enhancements that are urgently
requested by users. `P1` issues MUST be set to the *current milestone (`N`)*. If there is not enough time left in the current milestone to address
the `P1` issue, it must be set to the *next milestone (`N+1`)*.
### P2:
This label is used for the next level of priority. Issues marked as `P2` can be set to milestones `N`, `N+1` (preferred) or `N+2`.
### P3:
This label is used for low priority issues. Issues marked with `P3` label can be set to any milestone including `Backlog`.

In the last triage meeting of the monthly milestone, triage drivers or administrators must move all issues that do not have an active pull request
to the next milestone. Ideally, all `P1` issues should be addressed in their designated milestones. However, if that does not happen for any reason,
overdue `P1` issues can be moved to `N+1` milestone. Overdue `P2` issues can be moved to the `N+1` or `N+2`milestones. Finally, overdue `P3` issues can be moved to
the `N+1`, `N+2` or `Backlog` milestones.

If any issue has been moved two times already, then the issue must be re-triaged for setting the appropriate priority and/or the milestone.

## Reviewing Pull Requests

Pull requests need at least two approvals before being eligible for merging.
Besides reviewing for technical correctness, reviewers are expected to:

* For any PR that adds functionality, check that the PR includes sufficient tests
  for that functionality.  This is required in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../Contributing.md).
* For any PR that adds or changes functionality in a way that is observable
  by administrators or by authors of eBPF programs or applications, check that
  documentation has been sufficiently updated.  This is required in
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](../Contributing.md).
* Check that there are no gratuitous differences in public APIs between eBPF for
  Windows and Linux.
* Be familiar with, and call out code that does not conform to, the eBPF for Windows
  [coding conventions](DevelopmentGuide.md).
* Check that errors are appropriately logged where first detected (not at each
  level of stack unwind).

When multiple pull requests are approved, maintainers should prioritize merging PRs as follows:

| Pri | Description  | Tags      | Rationale              |
| --- | ------------ | --------- | ---------------------- |
| 1   | Bugs         | bug       | Affects existing users |
| 2   | Test bugs    | tests bug | Problem that affects CI/CD and may mask priority 1 bugs |
| 3   | Additional tests | tests enhancement | Gap that once filled might surface priority 1 bugs |
| 4   | Documentation | documentation | Won't affect CI/CD but may address usability issues |
| 5   | Dependencies | dependencies | Often a large amount of low hanging fruit. Keeping the overall PR count low gives a better impression to newcomers and observers. |
| 7   | New features | enhancement | Adds new functionality requested in a github issue. Although this typically is lower priority than dependencies, such PRs from new contributors should instead be prioritized above dependencies. |
| 8   | Performance optimizations | optimization | Doesn't do anything that isn't already working, but improvements do help users |
| 9   | Code cleanup | cleanup | Good to do but generally doesn't significantly affect any of the above categories |
