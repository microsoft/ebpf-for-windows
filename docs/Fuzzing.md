# Fuzz Testing in eBPF-For-Windows

## Overview
Fuzz testing is a test methodology that finds a class of bugs in the code-base
by generating random inputs and verifying that the code doesn't crash.

## Tests
The fuzzing tests are in the repo under tests/fuzz. Fuzz tests execute as part
of each CI/CD workflow. The tests generate a random block of bytes with a
length in the range from minimum input size for that method to minimum input
size + 1024. Many eBPF-For-Windows protocol messages contain a handle as their
first element, so the tests create several valid handles and insert them at
the beginning of the message.

## Reproducing a failure from CI/CD
At the start of each fuzzing run, the tests generate a random number seed and
prints it out to the console. The random seed appears similar to the following:
```
[Begin random seed]
6bcd4d9f e4be3204 66f59b19 fc13dfd0 49aee1d3 a9fec550 1a6aea17 b0bf0eb6
398939cd 565ea6ec 15e3c09d 1844f118 fcdf6860 1e892676 f8fa75af 84e23b43
..

c447caca c0626a08 4c6c8656 0c88d48c e20e975b 5e7ff362 bd982986 6e50d38f
[End random seed]
```

To reproduce a failure observed in fuzzing, copy this random seed into a text
file (```random_seed.txt``` as an example) and then set the environment variable
```RANDOM_SEED``` to the path of the file containing the random seed. The tests
will then use the provided seed instead of generating a new one, which results
in the tests repeating the sequence of steps that resulted in the crash.

## Reproducing a failure from artifacts
When a crash happens, a folder containing the unique crash will be created. Click on *Summary* in the build section. The following example shows the process of debugging for *verifier_fuzzer* which can then be used for other CI/CD steps as well.
Download the artifact and the associated build.  For example, if verifier_fuzzer "run_test (Release)" failed, download *Artifacts-verifier_fuzzer-x64-Release* and *Build-x64-fuzzer Release*.

Copy the crash file from the artifact folder to a separate directory,  *verifier_fuzzer* files including *verifier_fuzzer.pdb*, *verifier_fuzzer.lib*, *verifier_fuzzer.exp*, and *verifier_fuzzer.exe* from debug directory. The C Runtime library, entitled, *ucrtbased.dll*, and address sanitizer files, marked by ASAN need to be included, *clang_rt.asan_dbg_dynamic-x86_64.dll* ,and *clang_rt.asan_dynamic-x86_64.dll*.

Run a desired admin CMD locating to the copied files in the new directory, and enter with the following command:
```
windbgx -y SRV*;. -srcpath <your-path-to-ebpf-for-windows> verifier_fuzzer.exe <crash-file-name>
```
A window containing the windbg debugger opens up and enter ```g``` in the command box of windbg. If an access violation indicating ```Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance)``` shows up, please use ```sxi c0000005``` to ignore this error. Please use ```g``` again to see the line that crashes.

An alternative of running an admin CMD is to reproduce a crash to use the local latest build and run
```
verifier_fuzzer.exe <crash-file-name>
```
This method will show the line of crash in the source file.
